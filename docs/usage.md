## Interface

The user interface is pretty self explanatory. I ain't doing shit today I am
really lazy will document it later. Also the A/D keys mentioned below do not
work. I thought I might need them to do other stuff in my projects like move
and stuff so I removed the thingy...now you will have to use your mouse.
