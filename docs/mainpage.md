# Ankush's Garage

## My Projects

Welcome to the documentation for **A Collection of My Creations**!  
This project is a project built using C++, SDL3, and modern graphics APIs.

### Particle Simulator

I made a particle simulator, a while back. I re-implemented it to work in this garage. It is
faster than the previous implementation by a big margin also runs smoothly and more accurately.

It is available as the third example.

### Few Fractals

Made a few fractals to render. THey are really fast and low on the resources.

#### Normal fractal
#### Fern Fractals
#### Mendelbroth Set
#### Goldbert set

## Features
- Modular CMake build system
- Dynamic lighting with shaders
