fast as you can!

## My Projects
Welcome to the documentation for **Garage: A Collection of My Creations**!  
This project is a project built using C++, SDL3, and modern graphics APIs.

### Dummy Projects

#### SimpleExample
I made this absolute rubbish to test my documentation website and lay a
foundation for creating other projects...as of now it clears screen that too
with undefined behaviour in it...ðŸ˜­ I promis I will fix em later.

#### Triangle
A very important thing every renderer must have! This might be better reference
to make other projects than SimpleExample...

### Real Projects
#### Boids
I made a simple Boids simulation (Birds bOdy Iodine Diodes). That is legit the
full from of Boids! Simply put it replicates the behaviour of a flock of birds!

It is available as the third example.

#### Few Fractals (Under Construction)
Hey I made a website and now I have to fill it up with something right!

@todo None of the fractals are done.... I have already made a few fractals in
my learning arc....in my project arc I want to do something new! So...I will do
it (later) I will try to make them run in GPU instead of CPU.

Made a few fractals (I want) to render. THey are (should be) really fast and low on the resources.

##### Normal fractal (Da tree)
Writing some stuff because I can.

##### Fern Fractals
Bushes, it was someone's name too I think.

##### Mendelbroth Set
Looks the best imho

##### Goldbert set
I am a little foggy never implemented it but wasn't this the 3d fractal?

## Features
- Modular CMake build system (Yeah I worked hard on that yk)
- Dynamic lighting with shaders (Oh really?)

## Getting Started

To build the project:

@warning are anyone even reading these?

```sh
