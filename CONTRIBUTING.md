Thank you for showing interest in contributing to my project.
However, at this time, I’m not open to external contributions.

This project is something personal to me, something I want to build entirely on my own. If you have ideas or suggestions, feel free to open an issue. I’ll be happy to consider them and work on improvements myself. But I won’t be accepting any pull requests.

If that doesn’t sit well with you, I understand, and you’re absolutely welcome to fork the repository and build your own version. But Ankush's Garage will remain my own.

I know there are many great engineers out there who could improve this project many times over, but that’s not what I want for this. I do welcome feedback, advice, or even criticism, please share your thoughts via issues.

Thanks again for understanding.
